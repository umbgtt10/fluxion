Execute sync-readme-examples.ps1 and ensure that the code snippets in the documentation are up to date.
Then perform a fully-fledged review of the whole documentation including:
 - md files
 - comments
 - method documentation
And ensure:
 - absolute consistency
 - no broken links
 - no broken tables
 - all the operators (new and old) are correctly documented
Provide a detailed report of the changes required to have a bullet-proof documentation.
Do not change anything for now!


Pay particular attention to the PITCH and the outer README!
