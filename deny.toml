# cargo-deny configuration: allow common permissive licenses used by this workspace
# This file is used by `cargo deny check` to enforce licensing policy in CI.

[licenses]
# Allow common Rust ecosystem licenses used by dependencies and our crates.
# Some crates use composite SPDX expressions such as "(MIT OR Apache-2.0) AND Unicode-3.0",
# so we must allow the additional license identifiers (e.g., Unicode-3.0) as well.
allow = ["MIT", "Apache-2.0", "Unicode-3.0"]

# Optionally, you can add SPDX exceptions or more strict rules later.
# See: https://embarkstudios.github.io/cargo-deny/ for configuration details.
