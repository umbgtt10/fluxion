Fluxion is a 100% Rust implementation of composite Rx-style stream operators and helpers focused on correct temporal ordering and efficient async processing.

Quick links
- Crates: `fluxion-stream`, `fluxion-exec`, `fluxion-test-utils`
- Docs: generated by `cargo doc` (see `target/doc`)

Getting started

Prerequisites: Rust (recommended toolchain is pinned by `rust-toolchain.toml`).

- Build and run tests for the whole workspace:

```powershell
cargo build --all
cargo test --all-features --all-targets
```

- Run the local CI helper (PowerShell):

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\.ci\ci.ps1
```

Workspace overview

- `fluxion-stream` — stream combinators and timestamping helpers (ordering guarantees)
- `fluxion-exec` — execution utilities and subscription helpers for async processing
- `fluxion-test-utils` — shared test helpers, fixtures and sample data used by tests

Development notes

- Clippy, formatting and documentation warnings are treated as errors in CI.
- Local scripts live in `.ci/` (use `coverage.ps1` to collect coverage locally with `cargo-llvm-cov`).

TODO
- [ ] Bench all remaining stream extensions and record results in `target/criterion`.
	- Suggested list: `combine_latest`, `combine_with_previous`, `merge`, `merge_ordered`, `merge_with`, `with_latest_from`, `take_latest_when`, `take_while`, `select_all`.
- [ ] Investigate a clean way to suppress unit-test harness noise when running `cargo bench`.
	- Consider options: `cargo -q bench`, running the bench binary directly, per-package bench (`-p`), or a `.ci/bench.ps1` wrapper that builds then executes bench executables.
